# ðŸ–– Vue.js 3 ðŸ––

## Requirements

In order to use express, we need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and NPM installed. Head [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download NodeJS (and NPM, which is packaged in to the download)!

If you are not on Mac or Windows, check out [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for more installation instructions.

## Lets get started

Be sure to have NodeJS installed!

You can check to make sure everything is installed properly by opening a terminal and running `node -v && npm -v` which should show two version numbers! As long as you get 2 lines of numbers, you'll be good for this lesson! If you're having problems, just Google `installing node [PLATFORM]`, like "installing node windows" and they should help you out. Google and StackOverflow is your friend!

### Setting up our project

Lets get started by going in to a directory that we want to do create our project. Open a terminal where you want your project to be.

```vue create --preset hacksu/vue-tutorial test2```
